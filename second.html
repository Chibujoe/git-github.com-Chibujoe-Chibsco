    <h1>Chemical Equation</h1>

    <p>
Chemical equations make use of symbols to represent factors such as the direction of the reaction and the physical states of the reacting entities. <br>Chemical equations were first formulated by the French chemist Jean Beguin in the year 1615.

<br>Chemical reactions can be represented on paper with the help of chemical equations, an example for which is represented below (for the reaction between hydrogen gas and oxygen gas to form water).

2H2 + O2 â†’ 2H2O.

<br>It can be observed in the example provided above that the reacting entities are written on the left-hand side whereas the products that are formed from the chemical reactions are written on the right-hand side of the chemical equation.
